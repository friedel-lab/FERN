/**

 * The <code>AmountManager</code> is one of the most important connections between a 
 * {@link Network} and a {@link Simulator}. Each <code>Simulator</code> calls the 
 * <code>performReaction</code> method when it fires a reaction. The amount manager then
 * reflects the change of its reactant / product populations. Additionally, the
 * {@link PropensityCalculator} uses <code>getAmount</code> to calculate the propensity
 * of a reaction.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible (and necessary for the tau leaping algorithms) to save the actual
 * amount of each species and, if some error happened, restore these saved values.
 * <p>
 * The amounts are stored in an array.
