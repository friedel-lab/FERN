 * 
 * Implementing classes of <code>NetworkSearchAction</code> are able to control/watch searches in
 * {@link AnalysisBase}. On the one hand they control by using <code>checkReaction</code>, <code>checkSpecies</code> (control
 * if a network node should be visited) and <code>getAdditionalSpeciesNeighbors</code>, <code>getAdditionalSpeciesNeighbors</code>
 * (if there are other neighbors to visit e.g. catalysts of reactions).
 * On the other hand they can watch the searches by implementing <code>reactionDiscovered</code>, <code>reactionFinished</code> and
 * <code>speciesDiscovered</code>, <code>speciesFinished</code>.
